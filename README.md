# SDXL_DreamBooth_LoRA
This repo contains the Colab script to finetune Stable Diffusion XL(SDXL) model with DreamBooth and LoRA.

Additionally, it includes modules for data preprocessing, model evaluation, and visualization of results.

I have used a few images of my cat Maya to fine tune the model. You can see the example prompt outputs below.
